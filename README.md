# Python MyAnimeList Bot

This is a python rewrite of https://github.com/Lastmentor/MyAnimeList_FriendBot 

I created this because the original repository is 2 years old with no updates and the bot was skipping 50% of users.

## Improvements
- Simple Cache - Adds users only once
- Random Add Intervals - More Friend Requests go through
